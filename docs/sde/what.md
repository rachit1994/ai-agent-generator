# SDE baseline overview (single source of truth)

**In plain words:** this file is the **ground truth for the current local tool** (`sde`): what machines and models we assumed, which **commands** exist, and what “baseline vs guarded pipeline” means. It is **shorter and more concrete** than the big V1–V7 specs — read it first if you just need to **run** the CLI.

## Goal

Build a local CLI SDE baseline that tests whether guardrails + a staged execution
pipeline improve outcomes versus a plain one-shot baseline.

**Product trajectory (north star):** SDE grows into the **single orchestrator** that drives **full-stack product delivery** the way a small company would: **parallel junior-class agents**, mandatory **reviews and verification**, **governed self-learning**, and **gates that support reliable production pushes**. Staged specs **V1–V7** under `docs/coding-agent/` are **one combined roadmap** toward that outcome; **V1 execution safety always dominates**. See [../onboarding/action-plan.md](../onboarding/action-plan.md) and [../architecture/architecture-goal-completion.md](../architecture/architecture-goal-completion.md).

Implementation language/runtime:
- Python 3 CLI (installable import package **`orchestrator`** under `src/orchestrator/`; wheel / CLI names remain **`sde`** / **`agent`** per `pyproject.toml`).

## Timebox And Environment

- Timebox: 2 days.
- Machine constraints:
  - OS: macOS 26.3.1 (Darwin 25.3.0)
  - CPU: Apple M1 (8 cores)
  - RAM: 16 GB
  - Disk available: ~29 GiB

## Model Strategy

- Primary runtime: local `ollama` (no API token required).
- **Qwen line:** defaults use **Qwen3** on Ollama ([library `qwen3`](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3)). SDE pins **`qwen3:14b`** in `RunConfig`; use smaller tags (`qwen3:8b`, `qwen3:4b`, …) or **`qwen2.5:*-instruct`** only if you explicitly choose them in config.
- Implementation model: `qwen3:14b` (all coding/execution agents).
- Non-implementation model: `gemma 4` (planning/review/research/support agents).
- Optional local alternate for implementation: `llama3.1:8b-instruct`.
- API fallback: allowed only when documented triggers fire.

## Agent Role Model Assignment

- Use `qwen3:14b` for implementation-critical tasks:
  - writing/refactoring code
  - test authoring and fixes
  - benchmark execution and artifact generation
- Use `gemma 4` for non-implementation tasks:
  - planning and breakdown
  - checklist tracking
  - review summaries and documentation polish
  - analysis and risk enumeration

Fallback triggers:
1. Guarded structured-output validity < 85% after stabilization.
2. Guarded pass rate remains below baseline after two iterations with clear
   model-quality failures.
3. Local median latency is impractical for local SDE execution.

If fallback is used, rerun full A/B and document provider/model/reason in
`report.md`.

## Product Surface

CLI commands:
- `sde run --task "..."`
- `sde benchmark --suite ./data/benchmark-tasks.jsonl` (optional `--max-tasks N`, `--continue-on-error`, **`--resume-run-id <run_id>`** to continue under `outputs/runs/<run_id>`; `--suite` optional on resume but must match the manifest if provided)
- `sde report --run-id <id>`
- `sde replay --run-id <id>` (optional `--format json|html`, `--write-html` to save `trajectory.html` in the run dir, `--rerun` for single-task re-execution from `run-manifest.json`)

Modes:
- `baseline`: `task -> model -> output`
- `guarded_pipeline`: `planner_doc -> planner_prompt -> executor -> verifier -> executor_fix(optional, max 1) -> verifier_fix(optional) -> finalize`

## Required Guardrails

1. Input validation (non-empty + schema-valid task payload).
2. Output schema validation (fail closed on malformed outputs).
3. Retry cap (maximum one repair retry).
4. Timeout cap (per-task execution limit).
5. Token cap (per-task token budget).
6. Refusal policy for unsafe/invalid actions with machine-readable reason.
7. **Static code gates** (local, no sandbox): `static_gates_report.json` on successful runs — Python `ast` parse, high-signal dangerous patterns (e.g. `eval`, `subprocess`…`shell=True`), optional `ruff check` when `ruff` is on `PATH`. Failures surface in the verifier and in **HS04** (see [execution.md](../coding-agent/execution.md)).

## Minimal Architecture

Components:
1. CLI entrypoint + command parser
2. Runner
3. Mode implementations (`baseline`, `guarded_pipeline`)
4. Guardrails
5. Model adapter (`ollama` default, `api` optional fallback)
6. Evaluator
7. Storage (`traces.jsonl`, `summary.json`)
8. Reporter (`report.md`)

## Core features status (after pull)

For a **maintainer-facing** table of what is implemented vs SWE-agent / OpenHands–class patterns (and what is intentionally out of scope for local CLI), see **[`core-features-and-upstream-parity.md`](core-features-and-upstream-parity.md)**.

## Experiment And Verdict Rules

Task suite:
- 10-30 tasks
- includes simple, medium, and failure-prone tasks
- each row has `task_id`, `prompt`, `expected_checks`, `difficulty`

Primary metrics:
- pass rate
- reliability score

Secondary metrics:
- p50/p95 latency
- estimated cost per task
- retry frequency
- structured-output validity rate

Verdict:
- `supported` if pass-rate delta >= 10 points AND reliability improves AND
  median latency degradation <= 30%
- `partially supported` if pass improves but latency/cost degrade materially
- otherwise `rejected` or `inconclusive`

## Required Test Coverage

1. Guardrail unit tests (pass/fail cases for all guardrails).
2. Pipeline integration tests (stage order and trace emission).
3. Benchmark parity tests (same suite/settings/provider per pass).
4. Artifact integrity tests (`traces.jsonl`, `summary.json`, `report.md`).
5. Verdict logic tests (threshold branches).

## In Scope

- Local CLI SDE baseline only.
- A/B benchmark and report generation.
- Traceability and measurable verdict.

## Out Of Scope

This section lists what the **baseline SDE release described in this document** does not yet implement. Those capabilities are **in scope for the program** under [../onboarding/action-plan.md](../onboarding/action-plan.md) and later `docs/coding-agent/*` extensions—not abandoned.

- Multi-agent lifecycle systems (see V7 [../coding-agent/organization.md](../coding-agent/organization.md)).
- Distributed/event-sourced production architecture (see V4 [../coding-agent/events.md](../coding-agent/events.md)).
- Cloud deployment and scaling (optional; `local-prod` remains the production profile per master doc).
- UI/dashboard work.
- Production-grade org authz/policy systems (see V7).

## Definition Of Done

1. `sde run` succeeds and returns run id.
2. `sde benchmark` runs both modes on same suite.
3. Required artifacts are written per run.
4. `sde report` emits clear verdict and recommendation.
5. Entire flow runs locally within machine constraints.
